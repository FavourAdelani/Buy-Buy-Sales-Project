## Introduction
This is a Power BI project on sales data for a store called **Buy-Buy Store**. This project is to analyze and derive insights to answer critical questions and allow these insights/answers provided to be used to make better decisions going forward as a business.
**_Disclaimer_**: This dataset was gotten from my mentor for me to practice and build a dashboard using Power BI.

## Problem Statement
1.	What are the top 5 countries by order quantity?
2.	How much revenue was generated from accessory sales?
3.	How much revenue generated in 2015?
4.	What is the order quantity by gender?
5.	How much revenue generated by each product category?
6.	What is the order quantity for each product sub-category?
7.	What are the top 10 states by revenue generated?

## Skills and Concepts Demonstrated
The following Power BI features were incorporated: Bookmarking, DAX, Page navigation, New Measures, Modeling Filters.

## Modelling:
The dataset is just a table, so I did not do any modeling.

## Visualization
This report contains a single page.
You can interact with the report here (https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/bc9f8025-d380-419c-aedf-9a801d641b9c/ReportSection?experience=power-bi)
